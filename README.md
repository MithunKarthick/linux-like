# linux-like
Simple, light-weight batch script for windows that brings **Linux commands to windows command prompt** (as simple as that).

### Installation
* Clone or extract this repo
* Run the file **main.bat** as administrator and select install option

### Supported Commmands
You can find the update commands list [here](https://github.com/MithunKarthick/linux-like/blob/master/supportedComments.md). I will keep on updating this list as time permits. Feel free to create pulls.

### Custom commands
This repo uses the doskey file with aliases. You can create your own commands based on you needs that will make life a lot easier. 

Once you installed the linux-like, select `open doskey` option by pressing 2. At the end of the file, you will find space for custom commands with an example of notepad. 
> Note: you need to uninstall and re-install to update the custom commands.

### Issues 
There are few issues like copying multiple files and such. Since this is initial version, I will try to fix these in upcomming versions. I will be much obliged to merge some pulls
